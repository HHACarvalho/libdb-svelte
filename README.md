Web application build with Sveltekit that serves as the user interface portion of the project.

# Building the application

After installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and filling in the missing information in the .env file, run the [publish.sh](https://github.com/HHACarvalho/libdb-svelte/blob/main/publish.sh) script. Note: It is recommended that the approach in the main LibDB repository be used.
